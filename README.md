Welcome! This is the repository for the code that we are running on the data aquisition system. The DAQ that we are running is using a Beaglebone Black with Wifi, with the following sensors connected:
	- 4 linear potentiometers 		(shock displacement)
	- 1 Inertial measurement unit 		(orientation and general acceleration of chassis)
	- 2 Accelerometer 			(low amplitude, used for frequency analysis)
	- 1 Brake light sensor 			(contextual awareness for post processing)
